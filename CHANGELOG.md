# Unreleased

## Added
- Added summary view to the end of tests
- Added `LabelledProgressView` to display a labelled progress bar with an animatable value
- Add `QuestionSummaryView` to display the summary of a question after a test.

## Changed
- Changed scroll view in markdown views on cards to not bounce. Makes it so the view only scrolls if the content is bigger than the view.


## TODO
- [ ] Write some tests
- [ ] Updated constraint helpers to not default to `safeArea` (mostly because it seems to cause issues with content in scroll views.)
